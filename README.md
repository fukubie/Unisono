# Unisono

A static front-end demo for a **student interaction app** that connects students from different majors to collaborate on real industry-level problems.

## Purpose

Unisono is a concept app (CGI consulting group idea) designed to:

- **Connect students across disciplines** — Match students by interests (sustainability, software evolution, product development, etc.) so they can work together on real-world challenges.
- **Bridge campus and industry** — Use Blackboard profiles and curriculum guides as identity, and surface problems from campus company partners and industry news.
- **Guide collaboration with a clear path** — A Duolingo-style journey: sign up → pick interests → see a problem feed → join a project → complete levels by having every team member upload their portion (research → draft → presentation).
- **Encourage engagement** — Streaks, video uploads, campus map, and QR code hunts keep students active and exploring campus resources.

The goal is to help students meet peers from other majors, understand how different disciplines solve problems, and build industry-ready skills—all while exploring campus.

## What’s in this repo

- **Static site only** — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No backend or build step.
- **Blackboard-inspired UI** — Navy primary color (#004684), card layout, clean typography.
- **Duolingo-style path** — Vertical journey with labels to the left of circles and step-by-step progression.
- **Interactive demo flow** — “Try demo” walks through: sign up → interests → feed → project roadmap (with unlockable levels) → campus interaction and a fake 32-day streak.
